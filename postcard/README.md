This directory is for software related to automating the creation of postcards for waste management violations.

* `csv2postcard.py` will create postcards from a CSV file of violation records
* `db2postcard.py` does the same, but from database, instead
* `cardlatex.py` module that supports generating LaTeX for postcards; used by both of the above
